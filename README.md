## Phone book API challenge

The aim is to create an API that will serve as the backend for a phone book app, providing a list of people and their contact details.

## Main features

- Each contact record should show at least the name, phone number (work, home, mobile, and other), email address, and mailing address of each contact.
- There should be some access control (e.g. API tokens).
- The API should support listing contacts, with sorting, and pagination.
- Creating, updating, and deleting records should be supported.

$docker-compose up
```
